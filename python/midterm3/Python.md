Seng Midterm threee rundown of things that are covered:

# Reading and writing python code
- function calls
- modules and packages - crap
- data structures, list, dictionary, set, tuple
- File : read,  write, open and close
- data types and casting
- interpretor


# Think
- print statment dictionary question 5/5
- lambda function question I got 5/5
- stack and Queue 5/5
- file: I got most of of the marks 3/5
- part marks on moduale questions 2/5

20/25 - honestly think
 
# test
4. FIFO is the queue: first in first Out
LIFO is the stack: last in first out 
if there was a linked list: where a,b,c,d where added in their respected order:
linked-list: a -> b -> c -> d
if it was a Stack; linked-list.pop = d
if it was a queue:l inked-list.deque = a

1. Pascal was invented in1970
Python was invented in1991
Age difference is21years

5. the python project has: _pycache_ pack1, pack2, pack3, proj.py
This python project has one main class, proj.py, and three supporting modules (like a code library) in forlders: pack1, pack2, pack3,
the cache and _pycache_ are bytecode folders that python interpretor created to make an executable of this program. 
mod1.cpython-37.pyc: As there are many verions of python (python 3.7 in this case) and there are many classes in this program for every supporting class this program had there is cache of the moduales in each pack# is stored
_init_.py - object-orienting funcition for specific objects - in this case packs


2. in the main program you not only need to import your module but also at the dir() function
import pack1
x = dir(plack1)

6. Lambda is a mini function without a name. This anonymous function is useful in a case of needing to make a big data adjustment only once in your program or for a short period of time. 
 It could be inbetween function calls to that each the output of one fits perfectly into the input of the next
 It saves space in your program and lets you write more diverse functions


# creating better habits: Reality check
# DID
- did spend a full day playing with python
- I did write a good assignment 2 that passed all the tests
- I did make a study sheet - tried to make is useful for others
- look through lecture slides and previous tests
# did NOT
- attend lecture or go watch lecture videos attentively: they go on and on: 
- attend or finish labs: they are little of your grade take up ssoooo much time and energy - TA's are bad
- did not make sure I knew what the modules and packages where - oops - tried put up a fight
# Reality :
- Good performance: did really well with what I had:  
    - thinking clearly
    - I did the ones I new first 
    - I had resources
    - I am a decent typer
    - Really nice: really makes you think - not just a fact or something that I had reherased 
    - could have read the questions clearly:
- preparation
    - WECS, Dance, Working Out, friends
    - Instagram, youtube
    - emotional: 
        - angry: struggling and misunderstood
        - sad: I feel astranged from myself when I am sad - repress emotions
        - anxious: paying for parking, driving, getting coffee: terrible emotions having notthing to do
        - judgemental: situations, others, self
        - resentment:
        - restless: 
        - misunderstood:
    - cope: silly, imagine a man who makes me feel safe, loved, understood, sometimes doing a little work helps sometimes it does not
